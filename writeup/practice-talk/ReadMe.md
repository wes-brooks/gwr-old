### Talk on &ldquo;Open access publishing: A researcher&rsquo;s perspective&rdquo;

These are slides (_in preparation_) for a talk that I will give for a symposium on open
access publishing, organized by the
[Ebling Library](http://ebling.library.wisc.edu),
[UW&ndash;Madison](http://www.wisc.edu).
The symposium will be on the morning of Thursday, 24 Oct 2013, at
the [Wisconsin Institutes for Discovery](http://discovery.wisc.edu/discovery).
