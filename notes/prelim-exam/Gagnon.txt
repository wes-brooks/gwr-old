Questions from Ron Gagnon during the prelim:

 - Can the estimated coefficient surfaces be made to transition gradually to zero?
 - How confident are we of the local selection results (how confident of zeros, non-zeros, and the regions where the transition occurs)?
 - Why use AICc for bandwidth selection but BIC for local variable selection?
 - Is there a BIC for the bandwidth?
 - Why would a person use one of the AICc, BIC, or GCV over the others?
 - Is there - or should there be - any spatial structure in the local Lasso tuning parameters?
 - Is there ever a reason not to use locally linear estimation?
 - Can the GWEN use the Lasso for shrinkage in addition to variable selection?
 - Poverty data example: 
  - Should counties be weighted by population for estimation and/or k-nearest neighbors?
  - Are areas with "no effect" of mining employment that way because there are so few people employed in mining there?
  - Validate by simulating individual people, aggregating them at county level, and then analyzing?
  - Can prior weights be incorporated into the model? (e.g. var[logit(p)] is not independent of p)
  - Incorporate negatively correlated covariates (e.g. more in manufacturing takes workers from agriculture) into the model?
  - Are coefficients believable for rare occupations (e.g. mining)?
